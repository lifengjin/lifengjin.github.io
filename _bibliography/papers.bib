@article{Jin2018,
abstract = {There has been recent interest in applying cognitively or empirically motivated bounds on recursion depth to limit the search space of grammar induction models (Ponvert et al., 2011; Noji and Johnson, 2016; Shain et al., 2016). This work extends this depth-bounding approach to probabilistic context-free grammar induction (DB-PCFG), which has a smaller parameter space than hierarchic sequence models, and therefore more fully exploits the space reductions of depth-bounding. Results for this model on grammar acquisition from transcribed child-directed speech exceed those of other models when evaluated on parse accuracy. Moreover, grammars acquired from this model demonstrate a consistent use of category labels, something which has not been demonstrated by other acquisition models.},

@inproceedings{Zhou2009,
abstract = {In this paper, we propose a hierarchically iterate model of human conceptualization and cognition. Based on the theory of dual structure of cognition and related physiological evidence, we firstly propose the notion of concept space in human brain and a corresponding conceptualization model. Conceptualization is the process of forming concepts in our brain. The concept of cognition process is then defined to introduce our unified iterative cognition model. The hierarchy within the iterative cognition is the logic of human cognition. Some visual cognition examples are employed to investigate our cognition model. With our conceptualization and cognition model, the processes of auditory cognition, visual cognition and more over, language understanding could be explained under a unified theoretical framework. Separate papers describing specific usages of the framework will be published.},

@inproceedings{Jin2018c,
abstract = {When interpreting questions in a virtual patient dialogue system, one must inevitably tackle the challenge of a long tail of relatively infrequently asked questions. To make progress on this challenge, we investigate the use of paraphrasing for data augmentation and neural memory-based classification, finding that the two methods work best in combination. In particular, we find that the neural memory-based approach not only outperforms a straight CNN classifier on low frequency questions, but also takes better advantage of the augmented data created by paraphrasing, together yielding a nearly 10{\%} absolute improvement in accuracy on the least frequently asked questions.},

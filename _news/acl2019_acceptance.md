title: Two papers to appear in ACL 2019!
---

Two papers from me and colleagues have been accepted by ACL.

*Unsupervised Learning of PCFGs with Normalizing Flow* looks at how
context embeddings like ELMo can be used with unsupervised PCFG
induction models to incorporate morphological, semantic and contextual
information.

*Variance of average surprisal: a better predictor for quality of
grammar from unsupervised PCFG induction* tackles the problem of
objective function in unsupervised PCFG induction. Data likelihood has
been used for induction, but the correlation between it and performance
is weak. What other indicator may be better at predicting grammar
induction performance?

Very excited to present and discuss them at Florence, Italy!

My name is Lifeng Jin. I am a PhD candidate in the Department of
Linguistics at The Ohio State University. My research interests include
computational modeling of human cognition and development, unsupervised
models in natural language processing and Bayesian modeling. 

My current
research focus is modeling syntactic acquisition -- what can
computational models tell us about language acquisition? What linguistic
universals are necessary for learning grammars? How far can models go in
terms of syntactic acquisition without meaning? How does morphology
interact with syntax in language acquisition? I aim to explore these
questions with unsupervised neural and Bayesian models on a diverse
array of languages.

In my spare time, I fish, hike and cook.
